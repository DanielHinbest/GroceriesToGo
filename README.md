# GroceriesToGo
This was the capstone project for Daniel Hinbest, Ryan Clayson, and Yash Gadhiya for Computer Programming and Analysis at Durham College. It is a grocery delivery website that would allow items to be added to a cart to be ready for delivery. It includes use of a store locator map, a search tool, and a standard view of what stores would be available and their products.

This project was built using:
- Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Spring Framework
- MySQL
